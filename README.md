# Policy Recommendation Engine


## About this project

This is the repository for the policy recommendation engine. The aim
is to assist countries lacking statistical and policy capacity to
identify and analyse policies available that may help.

## Why do we need this engine

There are 210 countries and territories in the world, of which at
least a third of countries has an undernourishment greater than the
accepted threshold of 5\%.

Hunger as we know it, is a complex issue. Ranging from the
availability of produciton and acceesibility by both physical and
monetary means, to the utilization of resources and
vulnerability. Yet, this is not the only problem countries face and
thus agencies working towards eradicating hunger often face contraints
in budget and resources to achieve its goal. In particular, skilled
statistician and policy analysts are in high demand to provide support
to decision making.

The goal of this recommendation engine is to bring together the data
and policies to identify key shortage in order to eradicate hunger and
also recommend appropriate policies based on the similar of other
successful policies.
