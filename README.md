# Policy Recommendation Engine


## About this project

This is the repository for the policy recommendation engine. The aim
is to assist countries lacking statistical and policy capacity to
identify and analyse policies available that may help.

## Why do we need this engine

There are 210 countries and territories in the world, of which at
least a third of countries has an undernourishment greater than the
accepted threshold of 5\%.

Hunger as we know it, is a complex issue. Ranging from the
availability of produciton and acceesibility by both physical and
monetary means, to the utilization of resources and
vulnerability. Yet, this is not the only problem countries face and
thus agencies working towards eradicating hunger often face contraints
in budget and resources to achieve its goal. In particular, skilled
statistician and policy analysts are in high demand to provide support
to decision making.

The goal of this recommendation engine is to bring together the data
and policies to identify key shortage in order to eradicate hunger and
also recommend appropriate policies based on the similar of other
successful policies.


## How does the engine work


## Project Timeline

### Phase (1)

* A global network portraying the curret state of the food insecurity
  in order to identify the current position of the country.

* A panel which identify dimensions in which countries are performing
  poor and well with respect to countries which has achieved zero
  hunger.

* Recommendation page which identifies countries of similar profile
  and also overview of countries commitment and action towards
  eradicating hunger. (Research from SOFI and other paper).

* Initial setup of the featured project page with a draft of the "food
  reach" project.


Deliverable:

1. Home page depicting the state network
2. Recommendation with country overview
3. Featured analysis page with Food reach project.

Deadline: 10th of December

### Phase (2)

* A log-in mechanism in order to record information of the user, location, affiliation etc.

* A data base in which relevant research working paper and policies can be uploaded and saved.

* A document harvestor and repository to harveset policy paper from
  other policy data bases and governmental websites.

* Integration of the policy database to the recommendation engine page.

* A designer to design the home page.

Deadline: 1st of June
